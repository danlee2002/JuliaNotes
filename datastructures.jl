#In Julia, Vectors, Matrices, Arrays, Tuples, and Dictionaries are common data structures to deal weightOnEarth
#Vectors are one D, arrays
a = Int[1,2,3]
println(a)
append!(a,4) #attaches values to Array 
println(a)
#The type of a vector can be verified using 
typeof(a)
#An important thing to note is that Julia indexing starts at 1
mat1 = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]
println(mat1)
#There are times we may need to initialize a 3d array
