#In certain instances, we may want to do operations on an element by element basis, let i denote the
#Let i denote the index of a vector A and j denote the index of a vector B
#We can perform operations on an element by element basis by broadcasting
#Example:
a = [1,2,3] # is a column vector
b = [4,5,6] # is a column vector
c = a .* b
